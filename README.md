# Dev Configuration

Hi, this is my configurations for everything I use on dev teams.

## Nerd Fonts

Install Hack Nerd Fonts and Fira Code

```bash
brew tap caskroom/fonts
brew cask install font-hack-nerd-font
brew cask install font-fira-code
```

## Vim

I'm only learning to use this. It is actually for gods.

## VSCode

Just plugins and themes.

To remember:

`code --list-extensions | xargs -L 1 echo code --install-extension`
